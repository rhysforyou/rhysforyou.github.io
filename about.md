Hey there, my name is Rhys Powell and I'm a university student from Wollongong, Australia, currently studying Computer Science. Outside of that I build apps for iOS and write lots of silly little programs in Ruby and JavaScript.

I like to talk and write about music, animation, and my fascination with ‘internet culture’, whatever that is.

## Setup

It's always fun, if a little vain, to talk about the tools you use. In my case I try to buy tools I know will still work great four or five years down the track. To that end, here's what I'm using right now:

* A fairly low-end 15" **MacBook Pro**, I bought in mid-2010. It sports a slightly beaten up aesthetic after being lugged around for over three years, but I like it a lot.
* An **iPhone 4S** which I use as my notebook, camera, task tracker and so many more things.
* A pair of **Sennheiser HD 280 Pro** headphones for my music.
* A **Nintendo 3DS XL**, which at some point became my most used gaming console.

on the software side I mainly use stock software, but there's a few things I find indispensable:

* I rely pretty heavily on **Vim** for most of my text editing needs
* I spend a lot of time in **Xcode** these days building iOS apps
* Whenever I need to mock up a UI or draw some interface assets, I find myself coming back to **Sketch**
* I have way too many notes in **Notational Velocity** that I sync to my iPhone with **Simplenote**
* I have a thing for old video games, **OpenEmu**, **Boxer** and **SCUMMVM** make playing those on OS X a breeze
* I used to mainly use iTunes for music, but in the past year or so I've been using **Rdio** more and more.
