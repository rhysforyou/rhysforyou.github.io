  Hey there! I'm graduating at the end of 2014 and currently looking for a job. If you're looking for a passionate, talented iOS or web developer I'd really appreciate <a href="/contact">hearing from you</a>.

**Probably write something here**

## Setup

Some fun facts for you. My hardware and software setup currently consists of:

* A 15" *MacBook Pro*, the best computer I've ever owned
* The stock OS X version of *Vim* with a dizzying and faintly terrifying array of config files
* *Xcode* for working on iOS and Mac apps
* *Sketch*, the most effortless tool ever created for UI design and vector illustration
* Hundreds upon hundreds of Markdown files valiantly held together by *Notational Velocity*
* Jams pumped through *Sennheiser* headphones by *Rdio*
* Too many old video games via *OpenEmu*, *Boxer*, and *SCUMMVM*

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LividOcelot).

Thanks for reading!
