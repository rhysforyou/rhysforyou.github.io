title: About
---

I'm Rhys Powell, an [extremely online](http://extremely.online) guy from
Wollongong, Australia. Since my uni days, I've built a bunch of iOS apps you've
probably deleted off your phone at some point, most recently as part of the team
at my wonderful employer [Bilue](https://bilue.com.au). In more recent times,
I've picked up modern JavaScript, along with React and Redux and found a lot to
like about that software stack. On my own time, I also enjoy toying around with
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), messing around with cloud infrastructure, and
voraciously reading about as many new and interesting topics as I can.

I'm passionate about writing software that's well designed, elegantly
engineered, and built to last. I think learning how to write good software
involves being open-minded to new approaches, constantly seeking out new ideas,
and applying that knowledge with pragmatism and restraint. It also involves
recognising software is never done, that good software engineering extends
beyond just writing code, and that it's important to recognise the social,
collaborative nature of software development to deliver the best product.

Outside of software development, I love watching old movies and TV shows,
playing esoteric indie games, and listening to a dizzyingly vast array of
musical genres. I try to seek out and understand things I'm unfamiliar, to
expand my ideas of what's "for me", and appreciate perspectives other than my
own. That said, I also love to sit down and watch goofy-ass giant robot anime
from the 80s from time to time as well; I know my comfort food.

# A Brief History of The Author

- **Some time in the mid-to-late '00s** your author discovers the world of phpBB
  forums and the intoxicating power of Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. He creates a
  lot of really terrible websites, launches a flash game portal with a few
  friends to get around the NSW schools internet filter, and learns how to write
  PHP and ActionScript really quite poorly.
- **Later, in the early '10s** the author takes the only programming course
  offered by his high school, learns enough Python to decide he doesn't like it,
  and luckily discovers Ruby, which he does like quite a bit. He read's
  [_why's guide](http://poignant.guide) cover to cover a few times, before
  learning Rails, getting completely fed up with Windows, and switching to
  [tolerable UNIX](https://www.apple.com/macos) so he can use TextMate like
  that Railscasts guy does.
- **Circa 2012** your listless author enrols in his local uni's surprisingly
  good Computer Science degree, and spends many dry lectures writing Ruby
  code on his rapidly ageing MacBook. Also hey, those things have Xcode on them
  it turns out, so he spends enough time messing around with that to learn iOS
  development. This potent combination of skills gives him license to quit his
  retail job and subsist on a mix of contracting, tutoring, and work for his
  university. He makes a few neat apps under the employ of that university,
  organises some hackathons, takes part in a lacklustre internship, and
  eventually graduates.
- **Recent years** a buddy from uni contacts your employment-seeking author and
  says "hey, remember that cool iOS stuff we did for the uni? I'm working at a
  place now that does even better work." So the author applies, gets that job,
  and has worked there up until now. It hasn't been smooth sailing the whole
  time, but there's something special about that place that's kept him there
  despite that.
