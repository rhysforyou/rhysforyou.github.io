<h1 id="thepracticalguidetoworkingwiththeuowproxyonosx">The Practical Guide to Working With The UOW Proxy on OS X</h1>

<p>Quick note, this guide is a work in progress, if you want to help out feel free
to file an issue or pull request on my site&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/rpwll/rpwll.github.com">project page</a> on
GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="gettingconnected">Getting connected</h2>

<p>To get on to the wireless network, just connect to the network labeled <code>UOW</code>,
not <code>UOW_WIRELESS</code>, just <code>UOW</code>. When you connect you&#8217;ll be asked for your user
name and password, these are identical to your SOLS logon. Once you&#8217;ve
connected, you&#8217;ll need to configure your proxy settings. On OS X the set up
goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar and click <em>Open Network Preferences</em></li>
<li>Click the <em>Advanced</em> button towards the bottom right of the window</li>
<li>Pick <em>Proxies</em> from the tabs along the top of the sheet that appears.</li>
<li>From the list of possible protocols, select <em>Automatic proxy configuration</em>
 and enter <code>http://www.uow.edu.au/autoproxy.pac</code> as the URL.</li>
<li>Save those settings and you should be able to get internet access in most apps.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently Building 3 does not have the newer Wi-Fi setup that most
buildings have, in this case you&#8217;ll want to connect to a network called
<code>ACHERNAR-BG</code> and follow the instructions above.</p>

<h2 id="usingcommonterminalapplications">Using common terminal applications</h2>

<p>Unlike most GUI based apps, terminal apps tend to ignore system proxy settings.
There are workarounds, but a lot of programs will need some special
configurations.</p>

<p>However, for a lot of apps simply setting the <code>http_proxy</code> variable will be
enough. To do this simply type the following command into the terminal.</p>

<pre><code>$ http_proxy=&quot;USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.uow.edu.au:8080&quot;
$ HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>USERNAME</code> and <code>PASSWORD</code> are replaced with your SOLS username and
password.</p>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>

<p>To use git over the UOW proxy you need to do a little extra configuration.
Simply run the following command in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global http.proxy http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.uow.edu.au:8080
</code></pre>

<p>As before, substitute in your own username and password to get this working. In
addition to running this command you&#8217;ll need to use HTTPS rather than SSH to
clone repositories. For instance:</p>

<pre><code># This is how you'd clone a repo over SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
# But that won't work, so instead use this following command
$ git clone https://username@github.com/username/repo.git
</code></pre>

<p>As long as you do that you should be able to clone, pull and push repositories
without any hassle.</p>

<h3 id="curl">Curl</h3>

<p>To use curl with a proxy, simply pass the proxy URL as an argument using the <code>-x</code> argument like so: </p>

<pre><code>$ curl -x http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.uow.edu.au:8080 http://www.google.com.au/
</code></pre>

<h3 id="rubygems">Rubygems</h3>

<p>To use Rubygems through a proxy simpy use the &#8217;&#8211;http-proxy` argument like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install rails --http-proxy http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.uow.edu.au:8080
</code></pre>
