Around a year ago I found myself growing fatigued with my work. 

I'd spent the better part of the past five years working primarily on iOS projects, and while I loved that platform, I found myself growing increasingly dissatisfied with it from an engineering standpoint. At the same time, I'd been growing curious about the state of modern JS development and started tentatively dipping my toe into that vast, intimidating world. 

Fast forward to today, and I've got multiple large React projects under my belt. I've been building projects using libraries like React and Redux, learning the intricacies of modern JS development, and growing a lot as a software developer.

So I've decided to write this post to talk about how I got here from there, the lessons I've learnt, and some reflections on the relationship between these two largely disjoint development communities.

- Frustrations with iOS
- Dipping my toes in
- Committing to this direction
- Taking it pro  
- What to take away from this

I'd spent the better part of the prior five years learning iOS development and honing my skillset in that field. It was that skillset that landed me my first job, a job that I've really enjoyed, one where I've been able to do work I'm deeply proud of. I really loved developing for iOS, and felt strongly aligned with the principles that platform embodied. The emphasis on strong UI design and fluid, delightful interactions resonated with my own tastes and priorities. 

But from an engineering standpoint, building iOS apps felt increasingly like fighting against legacy technologies. Sure we'd gotten Swift, a modern, delightful language that I really enjoyed working with, but Swift's modernity only brought into harsher contrast to how dated the UIKit and Foundation frameworks that underpin iOS were getting. And while the advent of a new language brought with it an excitement to experiment with new approaches to building iOS apps, these new approaches often came into conflict with the rigid underpinnings of iOS.

At around the same time, I'd been hearing a lot of noise about React and---more broadly---about the direction front end web development was heading. Libraries like React and Redux advocated for an approach to front-end application architecture that was utterly foreign to me as an iOS developer and---the more I looked into it---deeply exciting. Far from reinventing the wheel for no good reason, these libraries seemed to be pioneering an architecture that was genuinely new and elegantly solved a lot of problems I'd been facing in larger iOS codebases.

So I started toying around with JavaScript projects in my free time, tentatively dipping my toes into the vast and intimidating world of modern JS development. The more I learnt about this foreign world of software development, the more I grew to appreciate it, and the more my frustrations with the state of iOS engineering grew.

So I went with my gut. At a one-on-one catch up meeting with my boss, I talked to him about the fatigue I'd been feeling with iOS, and expressed that my interests were moving more towards JavaScript. I'm lucky to work for a really great company that gives me a lot of flexibility in my role, so my boss said he'd see what he could do. Not long after, I finished up with my current project and began working on a new project in React Native, a good halfway point between my mature iOS skills and my still-nascent JS knowledge.

So the following are some of my thoughts from this past year or so of embracing JavaScript development.
