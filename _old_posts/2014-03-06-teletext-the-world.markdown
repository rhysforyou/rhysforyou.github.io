Apparently Teletext was mainly a European thing, but for whatever reason
Australia's Seven Network kept supporting it all the way up to 2009. It's a
fairly clever hack that exploits the excessive space reserved in PAL broadcasts
signals for closed-captioning to present arguably useful information like the
weather, or sports scores.

Anyway here's a website to help you make hella trashy images that conform to the
40x24 pixel, eight colour limitations of Teletext. It's pretty great.
