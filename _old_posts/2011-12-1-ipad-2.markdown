# Thoughts on the iPad 2 #

So I recently picked up an iPad, having barely used one outside of a store before this point. I had my vague notions of what it was like to use, based of brief encounters in store displays and the one or two times I saw people using them out in the wild, but other than that I was totally inexperienced in using it. What follows is a somewhat brief summary of my thoughts on it so far.

A quick note before we get started, the specific model I bought was the black iPad 2 with 16GB of storage space (about 14GB once formatted and with iOS loaded on) and Wi-Fi. I can't see the experience changing much based on how much storage space you have available, but 3G seems like it would have an effect on how  and where the iPad is used. So keep that in mind while reading my review.

Also I'm an iPhone owner, so I've had experience with iOS before this point, and I also own a Mac and use much of the same software there as I've been using on my iPad. With that out of the way, let's talk about the iPad.

## The Hardware ##

The first thing that stands out about the iPad is just how *solid* it feels; the buttons have a nice click to them, the devices edges feel rounded to perfection and the whole thing just has that feel of Apple quality. Also the device has a wonderfully simple profile, with it's buttons and ports al lhidden around the back edge, looking at it straight on all you see is a bordered black rectangle with rounded corners. I have to wonder just how much thought was given to every aspect of the iPad's industrial design, it's truly wonderful.

Another thing I've noted is just how good its battery life is, it easily gets 10 hours of battery when I'm just reading and writing on it. Games tend to drain it more rapidly but even then it beats my MacBook handily. I've never owned a device with a battery this good, no longer do I have to worry about how charged the battery is, lowering brightness and obsessively killing background apps. It's really quite a liberating experience.

Another surprise is just how easy it is to type on. Propped up with the smart cover to put it on a good angle, I can happily type on it at quite a reasonable speed, about 80% of my speed on a regular keyboard. Of course I still prefer a proper keyboard where I can get it but the iPad is more than good enough for taking notes on or drafting an essay.

One of the big additions with the iPad 2 was its cameras, a VGA camera on the front and a slightly more capable camera capable of 720p video on the back. Neither of these cameras is great, although more than adequate for video chat, where it's gotten the most use by me. The quality of the rear camera tends to fall flat in anything but bright direct light, but I guess it's better than nothing. I'm honestly curious to know how many of the people that complained about the original iPad not having a camera would use the camera on the iPad 2o often, not many I think.

Finally, the actual display deserves a mention. It's wonderful not quite as good as the Retina display on the iPhone 4 but easily a close second. Colours are bright and vivid, even compared to my iPhone and MacBook's screen. Since the iPad is almost entirely comprised of this display it makes sense that they'd invest in the best on the market.

## The Software ##

After being accustomed to using iOS on the iPhones 3.5 inch display for so long, seeing it blown up to a 10 inch display is initially quite odd. Everything is just a bit bigger, more spaced out, giving text and images more room to breath. Going back to the iPhone after using the iPad for extended periods of time feels comparatively cramped, almost suffocating.

Another thing to note, iOS seems less portrait oriented on the iPad. That's not to say it's landscape oriented[^1], the iPad doesn't seem at all concerned with which way you hold it. Almost every app on the iPad works in both orientations, even the home screen and lock screen. It happily adapts to whichever way you hold it. That said I've found portrait to be more suited to reading while landscape gets used more when I'm typing  or watching video. Hell, the iPad doesn't even care if you hold it upside down, something I often found myself doing unintentionally.

One of the main ways apps take advantage of the screen, especially in landscape, is by showing more levels of the navigation heirachy at once. Take the above screenshot of Instapaper, in the iPhone app, the left sidebar is all that is initially shown when a user launches the app. The user selects a  folder and then is shown the right view, filling the screen. In the iPad app however, the user can be shown both views at once when they're in landscape, allowing for easier navigation.

I've also noticed that the iPad tends to lend itself better to creating things than the iPhone. I'm already heavily using a lot of content creation apps, from Writing Kit and OmniOutliner to Apple's own iWork suite. The larger keyboard really does make the iPad far better than the iPhone in this regard.

In fact the more I use the iPad, the more I see it as just another computer, albeit one less conventional than the norm.
