## Who am I?

I'm Rhys Powell, a computer science student from near Wollongong, Australia.
I write software in my spare time and have previously been involved in several
open source projects. On top of my open source work I also wrote
[Parked](http://rpowell.me/projects/parked), a simple parking tracker for the
iPhone. I also write from time to time, publishing anything I'm happy with on
this site's blog.

I'm very interested in how technology can be used to teach both explicitly and
implicitly. By teaching *implicitly* I mean creating software that stimulates
people's natural curiosity and encourages them to learn on their own, software
that blurs the line between learning and playing. On top of that I'm very
interested in empowering creative types with software. The software I myself
enjoy using reaches an ideal point between simplicity, utility, and delight and
I aim for that in my own software.

As far as my technical skills go I've shipped software built with
Ruby—using various web frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra—as well as
Objective-C and the Cocoa framework. On top of that I enjoy playing with
functional languages such as Clojure although I've not yet had a chance to use
those skills in a larger scale project. Recently I've been a big fan of
Ember.js, a client-side web app framework written in JavaScript.
