## The Author ##

My name is Rhys Powell and I'm a hobbyist software developer, computer science
student, film geek and occassional writer currently living in [Wollongong,
Australia][wollongong]. As far back as I can remember I've been enthralled with
computers of all sorts, from the beige Compaq box my family owned as a child to
the MacBook Pro I now own.

I've worked on various open source projects over the years and really have a
passion for web development. I'm a big fan of the [Ruby][rb] programming
language and [Ruby on Rails][ror], an open source web app framework written in
Ruby. Outside of web development, I've worked on some open source iOS apps and
continue to be somewhat active in the independent game development scene.


## The Site ##

I write here. Not on any regular basis mind you, posts are published
sporadically whenever I find both the time to write and a topic to write about.
More often than not, I write about technology, culture, films, music and ideas,
posts can vary from the technical and philisophical to the deeply personal and
impassioned.

I've had a few sites over the years, when I was around twelve or so I had a
site hosted on Blogger where I would post the invariably crappy things I had
been working on. Following this I had a self hosted WordPress site which was
far more hassle than it was worth. For the past few years I had both a Tumblr
blog which I used as a sort of linked list and a personal page composed of a
series of HTML pages. Recently however,

However, I eventually decided that I just wanted a simple personal site,
somewhere where I could post the occasional article and where I could point
anyone who wanted to know more about me. This site is hosted on [GitHub
Pages][ghpages] and powered by [Jekyll][jekyll].
