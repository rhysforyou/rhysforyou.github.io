So I'm going to tell you all today about how spending 30 hours in a hot room, hunched over a laptop is one of the best things I've ever done from a learning perspective.

For the uninformed and uninitiated, [HackAGong](http://hackagong.com) is Wollongong's first ever Hackathon, an event where teams of coders, designers and the occasional business types form teams to hack out a cool project over a weekend. I was pretty green going into it and not entirely sure what to expect, but in the end I teamed up with a [super talented designer](http://www.jordesign.com) who I'd never met before the morning of the event and went on to win desks at the StartPad over the summer.

So with that in mind, I'd like to think I can offer up a few pieces of advice to anyone looking to compete in the future.

- **Design is everything** – I can't overstate this enough, while our idea was good and well executed, it was design that put us in the lead. Simply adding some animation to the page made for a *much* better demo and definitely got people interested. For all intents and purposes, your app is just an interface, make sure it's a well designed one.
- **Don't be too ambitious** – This applied even more to our two person team. What you really want is a simple idea that you can get working quickly and then put a ton of polish into. We initially toyed around with some more complicated ideas but decided to go for something simpler and were better off for it.
- **Experiment** – Our entire project was built in [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com), a framework that I'd only briefly toyed around with before the event. I used HackAGong as an excuse to play around with new tools, try things I wouldn't do in a larger project, and as a result I learnt a ton.
- **Don't take it too seriously** – Hackathons should be about fun first and foremost. My favourite projects of the night—[Melon.im](http://melon.im) and [The Towers](http://godhowiwishiwasassexyas.brennanhatton.com)—weren't the ones that made for viable businesses or were the most technically impressive, they weren't trying to be, that's what I love about the hacker culture.

So that's what I've learnt from HackAGong, I had a ton of fun at the event and really urge everyone to participate next time around.
