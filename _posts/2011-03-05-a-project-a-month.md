It's been said practice makes perfect, I for one don't believe in perfection,
but it still stands as a good phrase, all the theory in the world won't help if
you've never practically applied it. Yet so many university courses tend to be
heavy on theory, perhaps to the detriment of their students' coding ability. They
intend to turn their students into Computer Scientists, but that's not my goal.

So I'm taking things into my own hands, I'm commiting to making a working
project every month, whether that be useful code library, a web app, or any
other kind of software. I also plan to blog about the whole process here on
a semi-regular basis to improve my writing and communication skills.

This month I'm working on a web app to better organise the (markdown formatted)
notes I take in my lectures, making them easier to review, revise and rewrite
as well as making them accessible on any device I choose to use. The app is
built in Rails and I'll be putting the entirety of its source code up on GitHub
when it reaches a presentable state.

Wish me luck.
