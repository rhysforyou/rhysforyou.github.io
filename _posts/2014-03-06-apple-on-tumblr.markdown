Apple's web design team has been on something of a roll recently, and I'm really
taken with this page they've put together to advertise the iPhone 5c.

Each of the videos on it are short, simple, and very much reminiscent of their
_Intention_ video from last year's WWDCâ€”albeit much more playful.

There's a bunch of other well considered design touches to appreciate here. Like
the way a video's title is only displayed after you view it, encouraging you to
see them all. I also really like the way they've animated the transition between
the main page and the individual video pages.
