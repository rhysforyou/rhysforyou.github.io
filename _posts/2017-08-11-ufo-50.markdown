> UFO 50 is a collection of 50 single and multiplayer games from the creators of Spelunky, Downwell, Time Barons, Skorpulac, and Madhouse. Jump in and explore a variety of genres, from platformers and shoot 'em ups to puzzle games and RPGs. Our goal is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design sensibilities. 

This looks fantastic. There's a fairly widespread exhaustion with games that claim to have an '8-bit'[^1] aesthetic, but games like this, Shovel Knight, and Axiom Verge show that when it's done right, it can look fantastic. Spelunky and Downwell are both brilliant games, so I'm sure this'll be worth checking out.

[^1]: There's also far too many games that use '8-bit' to mean 'low resolution sprites'.
