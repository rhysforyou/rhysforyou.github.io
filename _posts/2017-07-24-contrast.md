Neat little Mac app for checking the contrast ratio between a text and
background color. The ratings it gives are based on a standard called the
_Web Content and Accessibility Guidelines_ which defines the minimum amount of
contrast between text and background colors for various font sizes to optimise
legibility.

It's worth pointing out that the word 'accessibility' here should really be read
as 'your site isn't exhausting to read for long periods of time'. Better
contrast on the web and in mobile apps benefits everyone.

($6.99 on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/contrast/id1254981365?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D6))
