> FatFinger is a library that allows you to run JavaScript full of typos. It will look at your code, attempt to guess at your intent, and do its best to make the code runnable. Rather than a tool to clean up code, FatFinger encourages the programmer to leave the code full of errors and fully embrace the chaos of JavaScript.

One of my favourite little details about this deeply ridiculous library is that you can use it by putting your code in a script tag with any misspelling of “text/javascript”. That’s the attention to detail I can appreciate.
