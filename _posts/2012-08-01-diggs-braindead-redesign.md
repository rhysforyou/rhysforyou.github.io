[Digg][digg] relaunched today amidst some fanfare with a completely rebuilt site, brand new iPhone app and complete repositioning of their brand. Overall it's a pretty nice upgrade and I wish them all the best in the futureâ€”Reddit and its ilk have gotten pretty bad over the past few years for actually finding interesting content. But there's one aspect of the relaunch that bugs me a bit, something that's by no means unique to Digg; the layout of its homepage.

[digg]: http://digg.com

Digg, like many other recent websites, has chosen to make its homepage layout some bizarre hybrid between Flipboard and Pinterest resulting in a jumbled mess of content that's hard to sensibly navigate. There's no clear discernible order to anything on the page, just a bunch of haphazard columns. The difference is best illustrated with a diagram:

<div class="split">
	<div>
		<img src="/images/posts/digg/regular.png" alt="Home sweet home" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<img src="/images/posts/digg/crazy.png" alt="The wild, wild west" />
	</div>
</div>

As you can see on a regular web page the reading order is clear, your eyes read through one article and then move down to the next. But in this new Pinterest-inpsired design there's no obvious order to the post, your eyes dart around, trying to comprehend the clustercuss that is this design and the website's functionality suffers for it.

I don't mean to damn anything that isn't a simple top to bottom layout, Flipboard for example does a wonderful job of presenting well laid out content. It just doesn't work as well with a scrolling webpage as it does with a paginated app. It's a symptom of people blindly taking inspiration from sites they find aesthetically appealing without considering how appropriate said designs are for their own software.
