I thought I'd check in and let everyone know what I've been up to over the
past month or so. It's been a busy few weeks with all manner of internships,
clubs, new projects and so on. I launched a splash page for HackUOW, a student
society, started on my first iPad app and talked to a bunch of wonderful
companies about getting an internship. I've learnt a lot and gone _way_ 
outside of my comfort zone on more than one occassion.

## HackUOW

If you've been following me on [Twitter][twttr] you'll have heard all about
this one. [HackUOW][hackuow] is a project I've started to create a community
of passionate, talented student developers at my University. It was created
out of frustration with courses that failed to excite students and open there
minds to the possibilities of software development.
