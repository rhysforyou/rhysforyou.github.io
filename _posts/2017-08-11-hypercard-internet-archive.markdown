> To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Hypercard, weâ€™re bringing it back.
>
> After our addition of [in-browser early Macintosh emulation](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_mac) earlier this year, the Internet Archive now has a lot of [emulated Hypercard stacks](https://archive.org/details/hypercardstacks) available for perusal, and we encourage you to upload your own, easily and quickly.
> 
> If you have Hypercard stacks in .sit, .bin.hqx, and other formats, visit this contribution site to have your stack added quickly and easily to the Archive: [http://hypercardonline.tk](http://hypercardonline.tk)  

I'm continually impressed with The Internet Archive's dedication to preserving computing history. If you like what they're doing, don't forget they could always use more [donations](https://archive.org/donate/)!
