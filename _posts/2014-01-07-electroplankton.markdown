To this day, it still seems crazy to me that something like Electroplankton exists. It’s not a game, not a music program, not a visual artwork, but a weird mixture of all three. At the time it came out Nintendo had this sort of perfect storm of unexpected casual appeal, unashamedly unique hardware, and most importantly, fantastic sales with a huge install base. And out of these most unanticipated circumstances came Electroplankton. A collaboration between interactive media and installation artist Toshio Iwai and the minds at Nintendo.

Like I said, it’s hard to pin down exactly what Electroplankton is, but I’ll do my best to explain it. The game is a collection of ten different organisms that can be interacted with in various ways to produce sound and visuals. These vary from the Hanenbow—little tadpole-like creatures that can be bounced between leafs to make chimes—to the Volvoice—which records audio from the DS’s microphone and layers effects on it. Each one of the organisms makes unique use of the DS’s plethora of inputs to create something really wonderful.

Unifying all thees organisms is the game’s distinctive and striking visual style. With it’s simple, unadorned aesthetic the game makes wonderful use of the admittedly limited hardware of the DS. Making heavy use of alpha blending, a technique that was impressive for handhelds at that time, the game’s various creatures take on the hues of their surrounding environment to beautiful effect. The game’s simple designs make it one of the more attractive early DS games.

The compositions you make with Electroplankton, if they can be called that, are very ethereal, delicate things. The game gives you no way to save your sounds in any way that would allow you to edit them later. Indeed if you want to share your creation, your best bet is to record into a PC from the headphone jack. But for most people, sharing a musical creation in this game means reconstructing it live. This turns the game into something more akin to performance art when shared with others.

Before I wrap this up, I want to give mention to the beautiful packaging the game comes in. The European version of this game comes in a clear, plastic case with the game’s cover art printed in monochrome on a reflective blue insert. The game’s manual is the real highlight however. Filled with hand-drawn illustrations and playful descriptions of the electroplankton themselves, it’s entertaining and does a great job at setting a tone for the game.

It’s tough to say if something like Electroplankton will ever happen again. With the current climate of the traditional gaming industry, it does seem unlikely. If a modern version of the game came out, it’d more likely be as an iPhone app which, while impressive in its own right, would be an utterly different experience. This collaboration between Nintendo and a celebrated interactive media artist, as unanticipated as it was, remains one of my favourite pieces of software for the DS, even all these years later.
