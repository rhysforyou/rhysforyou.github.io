If you ever spend much time around kids you'll notice that they ask *a lot* of questions, like a non-stop barrage of them. They're not overly concerned with seeming more intelligent than they are, just curious. Contrast that to most adults you'll meet: they're reserved, quite, and frankly *afraid* to ask questions.

What's the deal with that? It's like at some point we decide we've learnt everything there is to know and simply ignore any evidence to the contrary. When confronted with something that we don't know, our instinct is to feign intelligence, to act like we know what we're talking about. *That's incredibly harmful*.

Honestly, that's an untenable position for a software developer. Every day new platforms, frameworks and ideas come along that threaten to undermine all that we've learnt so far. Without the ability to keep asking questions—to keep learning—we're likely to get left behind.

So start asking questions, like a non-stop barrage of them. Because that's how we *learn*.
