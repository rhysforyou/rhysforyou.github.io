Vice's _Motherboard_ has put together a great little documentary following the iFixit team as they attempt to be the first people in the world to tear down an iPhone X.

iFixit is pretty well known in tech circles for their exhaustive, beautifully photographed product teardowns, but those are only a side-effect of their main mission: to create free repair guides that can teach people how to fix almost anything. In a world where the products we buy are increasingly treated as black boxes, and where companies like Apple use copyright notices to prevent people sharing official service manuals, iFixit is a valuable resource for people who want to make their tech last.
