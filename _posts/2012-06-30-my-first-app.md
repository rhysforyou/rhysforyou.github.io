I've historically not been the best at shipping things; I get partway through a project and my mind wanders to something else. But as we all know *real artists ship* and as I fell victim to my own procrastination I realised I hadn't shipped anything substantial in far too long. So I got my stuff together and learnt how to make iPhone apps.

Over the past month or so I've scoured docs, bugged people on IRC channels and fought my own desire to simply sit around playing SimCity to actually ship something. With that in mind I'd like to announce my first app: Parked for iPhone. You can learn more about the app over at its [project page](http://rpowell.me/projects/parked) but the short version is that it helps you find your car and remember to do so before your parking ticket runs out.

There's a lot I still want to do with the app but I feel I've produced a fairly solid 1.0 and I hope you'll agree. For something like a week I've been telling myself this app isn't good enough to release, but in that week I took a break from development and just allowed myself to relax and—upon looking at the app with fresh eyes—I'm now pretty happy with it.

I think this is something we run into a lot with the things we make, we get to close to our projects, approaching them with a magnifying glass and critiquing every little detail, we lose sight of the bigger picture. So many times I've gotten stuck in this mindset, seeing every bit of messy code and every imperfect asset; it demotivates me and it's why a lot of my projects fail. These things that I work on end up gathering dust on my hard drive and never reaching their users simply because I'm unhappy with the codebase or unsure about the UX design.

But for this project I did away with that perfectionist mindset, I looked at my project from the outside and realised that despite its imperfections it was worth shipping. Maybe the next time you're changing some code because it isn't DRY enough despite your app functioning fine externally you should just tag your last commit with 1.0 and ship the damned thing.
