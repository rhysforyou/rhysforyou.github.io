I've been thinking for a while that I should probably set up a personal site, somewhere where I could post things I've written, things I've worked on, you get the picture. So here we are, a brand spanking new site with a clean, no-fuss design, I'm really happy with it.

Now, I'm no designer, but thanks to some great open source projects and useful, free services I've managed to knock together something respectable. What you're looking at is a static HTML page generated by [Jekyll][jekyll] and served up by [GitHub Pages][ghpages]. In fact, the whole thing is open source, just [take a look][source].

I thought I'd share the process of designing and building this site in the hope that others may find it useful, so that's what I'm doing here.

## The Starting Point ##

Now the first thing I had to do was come up with some basic idea of how I wanted the site to look, feel and function.

I'd been experimenting with Twitter's [Bootstrap][bootstrap] framework and decided to use that as the base for my site. Bootstrap gave me a rigid grid to work with and really let me prototype freely during the early stages of designing the site. It also provides some nice default typography styles which I'm using pretty much as-is to make my articles look great.

I did make a few changes however, I dropped the grid column count down to 12 resulting in a site that's only 700 pixels wide. I also set the base font size to 16 pixels with a line height of 24 pixels. The result of all this is a design which is much more pleasant to read off.

Now early design looked [quite][prototype1] [different][prototype2] but I'm quite happy with what I settled on in the end. With a rough idea of the design in my head, I began to think about how I was going to build it.

## Derailed ##

Now, my initial idea for this site's implementation was to build a CMS in Ruby on Rails, simply put this was a *bad idea* for several reasons.

Firstly, this was my first big project in Rails and I was in no way experienced enough to build something as complex as I was imagining. The more I worked on the project, the more its scope expanded and the more I came up against my own limitations and lack of experience. In the end, I had a hard to maintain, buggy piece of software that really wasn't all that useful.

I was adding features upon features upon features, the feature creep was spiralling out of control. The app was growing more and more complex, what I really needed to do was step back and look at what I really needed, what I couldn't do without and just build that. But that's not what I did, and I ended up with a piece of software that was unfocused and poorly thought out as a result.

Lastly, it really didn't fit in that well with my writing workflow. When I get an idea for a post I'll usually throw it into an "ideas" note in [NValt][nv], eventually getting it's own note where I start fleshing out the idea. Finally I'll start a new Markdown document in my 'writing' folder where I'll write the full article. With my Rails app, I could copy this Markdown source into the app, but if I made any edits, I'd have to manually keep my local copy in sync. I tend to do a lot of editing after I put a post up so this was going to be a massive pain.

So for those reasons, I had to drop the Rails app and look for something else, something simpler and more attuned to my personal needs.

## Jekyll ##

I'd heard about Jekyll before, a Ruby gem that generates static sites based on template data and a directory of Markdown files, but never really payed much attention to it.
