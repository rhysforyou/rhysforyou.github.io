Erica Sadun with the highlights from today’s announcements on the _swift-evolution_ mailing list. The key thing here is the establishment of a focus for Swift 5, with the key takeaways being that we’re (finally) getting ABI stability, and that this release aims to lay the groundwork for concurrency. There’s also some changes to how language proposals are handled, namely that they must be accompanied by a working implementation. 

It’s good to see Swift maturing like this. I love working in Swift, and while often it feels like it’s not quite there, I know it’ll get there.
