Recently I've been introducing some fellow students to [Ember.js][] as a way to build modern, client-side web apps. In doing so I came upon this talk by Robin Ward (AKA [@eviltrout][]) that goes into some of the more advanced techniques Ember's architecture enables.

It's a great watch with lots of clever insights, in particular I was really impressed with the idea of view cloaking. In the land of Cocoa development, where I've spent most of the past few months, we have a class called `UITableView` which works in a very similar way and it's one of the most versatile, useful parts of the framework. It's what makes long list views on iOS scroll smoothly, even on the limited hardware of early iPhones.

To see that sort of advanced, performance conscious approach to front-end development used in web development just shows how far the practice has come. The kinds of apps we can build in-browser nowadays are so much more ambitious than anything I could've imagined when I started building web apps in PHP during high school.
