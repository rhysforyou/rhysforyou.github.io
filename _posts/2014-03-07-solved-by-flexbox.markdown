I'm really impressed with how much cleaner and more expressive the CSS3 Flexbox module has made my stylesheets. It's a much more powerful way to lay out elements on a web page, and it means I can do things that were next to impossible in the past, like vertically centering elements. This site provides a great overview of some use cases for flexbox, it's really worth learning about if you're a web developer.
