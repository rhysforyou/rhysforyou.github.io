title: Your Company Sucks at Open Source
subtitle: The perils of blind inspiration

Today [Chart.js][chart], a promising new open source project, was shut down on request of the creator's employer. It's tragic and sad, but it only serves to underscore a problem I've seen in a lot of companies that deal in developing software. The truth is most companies just plain don't understand open source.

An example would probably help here so I'll talk about the place I interned at over the summer. The overriding opinion there was that OSS was something to be exploited where it was useful, but contributing back would be 'sacrificing a competitive advantage'. This got to the point where we would build half-baked clones of open source projects to give us an advantage over competitors.

The truth is that if you want to get the best developers working at your company, you need to embrace open source. By restricting developers from working on projects in their own time you're alienating a whole heap of talented people. Additionally, nothing sours your relationship with a developer than the feeling that everything they make belongs to you.

On the flip side, strong open source projects can be a great way to attract talent. I for one find projects like Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), Square's [KIF](https://github.com/square/KIF), and thoughtbot's [paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) have done more to endear me to these companies than any job ad could possibly do.

Not to mention it's just plain more efficient to take advantage of open source projects. I can't count the number of wasted hours I spent reinventing the wheel last summer. Your company should optimise for pushing features and products out the door, anything you can do to make that process more efficient is something worth looking into.

It's really a shame that so many companies still don't get open source, and it's sad that [Chart.js][chart] has to be another footnote in this story. Hopefully successful tech companies like GitHub, Twitter, thoughtbot, 37signals and countless others will continue to set an example for how to embrace open source. Perhaps in time other companies will take notice.
