Really neat presentation filled with creative uses of SVG on the web. The one dampener I'll put on my enthusiasm for this is that SVG's performance characteristics areâ€¦ not the greatest. Some of these examples won't even run at full speed on my specced out MacBook Pro, so I doubt you'd see stellar performance on low-end mobile devices.

Still, having an easy way to manipulate vectors graphics as part of the DOM opens the door to so many cool applications, and a lot of these examples are wildly impressive.
