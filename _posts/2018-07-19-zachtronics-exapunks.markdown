The _Zachtronics_ house style of puzzle game design is something I have an intense fondness for. Where other puzzle games tend to be about finding the one correct solution to a tightly designed puzzle, Zachtronics games are more about coming up with your own solution to open-ended problems within a deliberately constrained possibility space. 

_[Opus Magnum][opusmagnum]_, Zachtronics' previous release, ended up being one of my favourite games of last year, so I really can't wait to get my hands on their new game, _EXAPUNKS_, which mixes their signature style of game design with a whole bunch of cyberpunk nonsense. It's hard to think of another game that feels like it's been designed so deliberately for my specific tastes.
