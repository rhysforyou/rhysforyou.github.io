Recently I've been writing _a lot_ of JavaScript. Thanks in no small part to frameworks like [Meteor][meteor] and [Ember.js][ember], it's fast becoming my most used language. But I had a bit of a problem you see, _I never formally learnt JavaScript_. Most of what I did know about the language came from years of wrangling jQuery plugins and looking at other people's code.

So I decided that, while I'm on break from University for a month, I would make an effort to get Really Freaking Good at JavaScript. I'd throw out every preconception I had about the language and start anew. Here's a bit about how I did that.
