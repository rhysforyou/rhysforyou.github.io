          <li><strong>Stay alert</strong>—When your parking is about to run out, Parked will give you a friendly reminder. You can also see how long you've got left at a glance.</li>
          <li><strong>Make a note of it</strong>—Need to remember what level of the parking garage you were on? Parked gives you a free-form notes field where you can write any useful information you need to remember.</li>
