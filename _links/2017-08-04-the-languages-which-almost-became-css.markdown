Really fascinating look at some of the early proposals for how to style the web. It’s interesting to see how heavily LISP and SGML influenced a lot of these earlier ideas, and there’s a neat aside about Netscape effectively transpiring CSS to JS in early days. On the whole though, I’m pretty happy with the solution we ended up with.
