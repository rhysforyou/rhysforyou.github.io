This website uses the Internet Archive to show you what a few popular websites looked like ten years ago to the day, and it makes for some fun browsing. You can, for example, visit Apple.com and see the recently announced iPhone featured prominently, or see IGN getting excited about _Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare_, a bold new direction for that series at the time. 

It's interesting to see how much the aesthetic of the web has evolved over the past decade. Reddit looks almost the same as it did a decade ago, while YouTube is practically unrecognisable.
