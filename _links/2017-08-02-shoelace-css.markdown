Very cool CSS starter kit based on modern CSS features like variables and `calc`. That means older browser support is potentially flaky, but thankfully polyfills exist.

I suspect if you used this on a large project, you'd find yourself wishing for the more sophisticated feature set of something like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), but it's nice to see plain ol' vanilla CSS slowly closing the gap. I can envision a future where the bulk of Sass's features are made obsolete by modern CSS, the same way ES6 made many [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) features part of the core language.
